# PHYSICS SIMULATOR ROADMAP 🚀

## CHOSEN PROJECT: ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD PLAYGROUND ⚡

### WHY THIS ONE:
- Most visually spectacular 
- Core physics concept students struggle with
- Interactive field manipulation = instant wow factor
- Builds on our previous EM work but way better

### PHASE 1: CORE FEATURES (Week 1)
- ✅ Interactive charge placement (click to add +/- charges)
- ✅ Real-time field line visualization
- ✅ Particle motion in fields (test charges)
- ✅ Drag charges around and watch fields update
- ✅ Beautiful WebGL rendering with glow effects

### PHASE 2: ADVANCED PHYSICS (Week 2)
- 🔄 Magnetic fields from moving charges
- 🔄 Current loops and solenoids  
- 🔄 Electromagnetic induction demos
- 🔄 Capacitor charging/discharging
- 🔄 LC oscillations

### PHASE 3: EDUCATIONAL TOOLS (Week 3)
- 📚 Built-in tutorials for each concept
- 📊 Measurement tools (field strength, potential)
- 📈 Graphs of E-field vs distance
- 🎯 Challenge problems with solutions
- 💾 Save/load configurations

### PHASE 4: MODERN FEATURES (Week 4)
- 📱 Mobile-responsive design
- 🔊 Sound effects for interactions
- 🎨 Multiple visual themes
- 📤 Share experiments via URL
- 🏆 Achievement system

### TECH STACK:
- Vanilla JS + WebGL (for performance)
- Canvas 2D fallback for compatibility
- No frameworks = faster load times
- Progressive Web App features

### SUCCESS METRICS:
- Intuitive within 30 seconds
- Runs 60fps on mobile
- Covers all major E&M concepts
- Students actually enjoy using it!

## BACKUP PROJECTS (if EM field is too complex):
1. WAVE INTERFERENCE STUDIO - easier math
2. PROJECTILE MASTER 3D - familiar concepts
3. CIRCUIT CONSTRUCTOR PRO - practical applications

## LONG-TERM VISION:
Complete physics education platform with all 12 simulators, unified progress tracking, and AI tutoring.
